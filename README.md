A genesis Parent Portal client app for Android

This is in a very early state, and is nowhere near complete. There 
are many features I want to add and bugs I need to fix before I
consider this project done, so stay tuned for many new updates!

Currently, this app only works for Android 5.0 and above, and 
only connects to Cresskill High School's parent portal. Feel
free to fork and customize it to get it working on your school's
parent portal, or add anything you feel is missing.
